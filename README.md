# python_minigame
This is a simple implementation using the Pygame library. The game creates balloons falling from the top of the screen, and the player's objective is to pop them by clicking on them.
The score increases when a balloon is popped, and the player has three lives. 
If a balloon reaches the bottom of the screen without being popped, the player loses a life.
The game ends when the player runs out of lives. You can adjust parameters like the number of balloons, speed, colors, etc., to customize the game further.
